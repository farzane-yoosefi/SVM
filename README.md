# SVM
>> These notes serve to demonstrate my machine learning knowledge to potential employers while also helping beginners learn complex concepts in simple terms.

**SVM** is a supervised machine learning model used to find the best possilbe boundary between classes.
it is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam not spam or cat vs. dog.
The main goal of SVM is to maximize the margin between two classes. But you maight get confused about what margin is.  
**Margin** is the empty space between decision boundary and the closest data point from the classes.  
**Support vectors** are those closest data points to the decision boundary.  
The larger the margin the better the model performs on the new unseen data.
## Key concepts of SVM 
- *Hyperplane* : 
- *Support vectors*
- *Margin*
- *Kernel*
- *Hard margin*
- *Soft margin*
- *Hinge loss*
- *Dual problem*
